## Abstract

The Nepali language has distinct linguistic features, especially its complex script (Devanagari script),
morphology, and various dialects, which pose a unique challenge for natural language processing
(NLP) evaluation. While the Nepali General Language Understanding Evaluation (Nep-gLUE) benchmark
provides a foundation for evaluating models, it remains limited in scope, covering four tasks. This
restricts their utility for comprehensive assessments of NLP models. To address this limitation,
we introduce eight new datasets, creating a new benchmark, the Nepali Language Understanding
Evaluation (NLUE) benchmark, which covers a total of 12 tasks for evaluating the performance
of models across a diverse set of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. The added tasks
include single-sentence classification, similarity and paraphrase tasks, and Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. On evaluating the models using added tasks, we observe that the existing models
fall short in handling complex NLU tasks effectively. This expanded benchmark sets a new standard
for evaluating, comparing, and advancing models, contributing significantly to the broader goal of
advancing NLP research for low-resource languages.
